<p class="paragraph"><br>  
     Monarch Dream means QUEEN. Queen has a Dream which is to be rich by her own thing that not need her own king. 
To show everyone that the Queen was not weak that the man thoughts to prove. A Queen has a dream by her own path to show that as an independent woman she can buy her own things/wants.

when she decided to do live selling which got boomed. 
The owner of Monarch Dream is my very own bestfriend, Maillet Alcance.
